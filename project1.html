    <h1><mark>PROJECT 1</mark>: <br> CONFOUNDING TOOLS </h1>
    <h2>The objective for this project was to design a 24” x 36” digital poster about <br> your life under COVID 19 <mark>without</mark> using software explicitly intended for design.</h2>

    <h3>WHAT IS THIS?</h3>
    <h4>For my poster I decided to work with screenshots from an FPS game called <mark>Valorant</mark>, and I used
        Google Sheets to structuralize my poster. </h4>
    <h5>FINAL POSTER, GOOGLE SHEETS</h5>
    <h6>I was inspired by this poster that was shown as an example from previous work. I really liked the idea 
        of how this poster shows a black hole and it feels like I'm floating around the poster just like the 
        objects around it with a sense of being <mark>lost</mark> and <mark>disconnected</mark>. I got the
        idea of using Valorant for my poster since I spent a lot of time playing during quarantine and
        staying home the past year. I intended to show how the game played a huge part of my daily
        <mark>routine</mark> and took up so much of my time by conveying that feeling of being sucked into a new
        video game.</h6>

    <h10>At first I experimented with the colours of my screenshots to create an image, then duplicating it
        and creating patterns. Every single image was 8x4, but as I was experimenting with different
        compositions, I noticed that they looked too even and organized which was not my intent. I also
        thought filling the entire sheet was too much and began to look similar to each other. Later on I
        screenshotted the same photos at random sizes which would create different sized white gaps
        in every cell on the graph and use more white space in my composition. At first I wanted to
        create a black hole, but I played around with distorting my composition randomly which began to
        create a glitch-like effect which I really liked because I began to think about how covid-19 is sort
        of a glitch that happened in our life. I also stopped trying to add such bright colours to my poster
        and focused more on the darker/muted colours to create a gradation from the black, as well as
        paying more attention to the shapes that the black squares were making and how it contributed
        to my intent.</h10>
