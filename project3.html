    <h1>PROJECT 3: <br> MEASURING TIME </h1>
    <plant>PLANT BUDS</plant>
    <pre>Objective:
        Clocks, calendars, period trackers, sleep alarms, sun dials, historical timelines, 
        tree rings, rock sediments, ice core samples, hairlines, musical scores, ice cream 
        left on the counter, foliage, playlists, school transcripts, wrinkles, and piles of 
        sand in hourglasses. All of these are ways that we gain a sense of our temporality. 
        Design a (preferrably but not necessarily) screen-based interaction that engages with 
        time measurement and/or management. </pre>
    <pre>Purpose:
        The purpose of this app is to improve consistant productivity for a couple hours per day.
        The user is supposed to select a seed based on how many hours they want to stay on the app 
        and the seeds range from 2 hours to 8 hours. The plant is meant to grow fully in one session 
        without closing the app, or else the progress bar bar will go to 0 and the plant will die if 
        the app is closed for more than one minute. If the user does not complete the plant, the plant 
        will die and wont be added to their collection amd will have to start over. The user can make 
        a list for what to complete and how much time would be spent on it to help keep them on track.
        This cycle of time repeats itself every time the user chooses to start a new seed. There is a 
        taskbar where the user can look at their plant, their friends, collection, and settings. The 
        friends page is to look at the productivity progress of their friends and could help motivate 
        the user to be productive knowing other people are working as well. User can also check what 
        their friends are working on and how far they are with their work.
